# Xojo-OpenWeatherMapOrg-API
A free Xojo class for accessing the OpenWeatherMap.Org API current and 5 days weather forecasts.
And also an example for sharing code. The OpenWeather folder is shared between Desktop, console, Web and Raspberry Pi app.
  
You need to enter a free openweathermap.org API id into the API_ID constant of the OpenWeather module.   
The city id (the demo is set to Trier, Germany) can be found here: http://bulk.openweathermap.org/sample/  
Either change it in the constant or forward it as method parameter when you request weather data.  
  
Sorry that the Raspi demo app outputs German text. Should be easy to modify.
