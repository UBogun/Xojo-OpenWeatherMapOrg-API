# Xojo-OpenWeatherMapOrg-API
A free Xojo class for accessing the OpenWeatherMap.Org API current and 5 days weather forecasts.
And also an example for sharing code. The OpenWeather folder is shared between Desktop, console, Web and Raspberry Pi app.

You need to enter a free openweathermap.org API id into then API_ID constant of the OpenWeather module. 
Please excuse me that the Raspi demo app outputs German text. Should be easy to modify.
